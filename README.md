# Cloud Computing
 This repo contains the project done in the course "Introduction to Cloud Computing".

The aim of this project is to deploy a CRUD application based on flask framework using AWS cloud infrastructure.


The objectives of the project are : 
•	Create a CRUD APPLICATION which can create, remove, update, delete records of employee and give a user friendly experience using flask framework . 
•	Creating a VPC with public subnet so as to access all services of public cloud provided by amazon web services 
•	Launching our instance on EC2 for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. 

Webapplication: 
In this code we have created our Mysql Database  configuration using Python Flask webframework, MysQL and Bootstrap CDN, HTML, CSS for frontend of the webapp. And this is our database model which is offloaded to AWS by creating a VPC.

TASK-2: MONITORING VMs
We create a dashboard for monitoring the metrics in the cloud watch.
The following metrics are to be monitored by the cloud watch:
• CPU utilisation;
• NetworksPacketsIn;
• NetworksPacketsOut;
• NetworkIn;
• Network Out.


TEST PART:
By using the Apache web server and Apache bench stress tool we would like to test the scalability with respect to computation by increasing the load or stress on the deployed website.
